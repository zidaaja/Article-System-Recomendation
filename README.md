# Laporan Proyek Machine Learning - Amazida

## Project Overview
Artikel adalah sebuah tulisan yang berisikan fakta dan berita yang dilengkapi dengan data. Artikel menjadi kebutuhan setiap orang untuk dijadikan bahan bacaan yang valid dan terpercaya. Segala macam bidang memerlukan sebuah artikel untuk mendapatkan informasi yang sesuai dengan yang mereka inginkan. Oleh sebab itu, rekomendasi mengenai artikel dapat membantu pembaca dalam memilih bacaan yang sesuai dengan apa yang orang baca.


## Business Understanding

Bagian laporan ini mencakup:

### Problem Statements

Berdasarkan uraian yang telah disebutkan, maka pernyataan masalah yang didapat sebagai berikut:
- Bagaimana cara merekomendasikan artikel yang mirip dengan artikel yang dibaca pengguna ?

### Goals

Menjelaskan tujuan proyek yang menjawab pernyataan masalah:
- Membangun sistem rekomendasi artikel yang dipersonalisasi untuk pengguna dengan teknik _Content Based Filtering_

### Solution Approach
- Melakukan analisis terhadap dataset yang ada dengan _Univariate Analysis_
- Melakukan pengecekan nilai NULL dan duplikasi terhadap dataset
- Membangun model _Content Based Filtering_ menggunakan vektorisasi teks TF-IDF Vectorizer dan menghitung derajat kesamaan teks dengan _cosine similarity_


## Data Understanding
Dataset yang digunakan pada projek ini adalah dataset [BBC News](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/malwyshihab/bbc-news-data-2).

Berikut seluruh variabel atau fitur pada data:  

Variabel-variabel pada BBC News Dataset adalah sebagai berikut:
- `Artikel`: Artikel seperti nomor ID
- `Text`: Isi artikel atau berita
- `Category`: Kategori berita atau artikel

Data memiliki 682 data dengan 3 kolom.

Dalam memahami data ini saya melakukan _Exploratory data analysis_ dengan melihat informasi pada data dan terdapat variabel `Artikel` yang bertipe data integer, variabel `Text` dan `Category` bertipe data object. Kemudian, melihat kategori apa saja yang ada didalam dataset tersebut dengan memvisualisasikannya menggunakan plot seperti pada gambar berikut.

Gambar 1. Visualisasi kategori yang ada di dataset

Dapat dilihat bahwa kategori didalam dataset tersebut ada 2 yaitu _sport_ dan _business_


## Data Preparation
Pada tahap preparation yang saya lakukan adalah:
### Mengecek apakah tidak ada data yang bernilai NULL
Saya menghitung nilai null yang terdapat dalam data, dan hasilnya adalah semua variabel atau fitur memiliki 0 nilai NULL, artinya tidak ada data yang bernilai NULL dalam dataset tersebut
### Mengecek apakah tidak ada data yang terduplikat
Saya menghitung nilai duplikat dalam data, dan hasilnya adalah semua variabel atau fitur memiliki 0 _duplicated_, artinya tidak ada data yang terduplikasi dalam dataset tersebut.

Tidak ada data yang memiliki NULL dan terduplikat, maka data kemungkinan sudah siap untuk digunakan.


## Modeling
### Membangun model sederhana menggunakan TF-IDF Vectorizer
Pada proyek ini, saya menggunakan fungsi tfidfvectorizer() dari library sklearn. Dengan menggunakan parameter `min_df = 0.01` untuk mengabaikan term yang muncul kurang dari 1% dalam teks, dan `sublinear_tf = True` untuk menormalisasi bias terhadap teks yang panjang dan teks yang pendek.

### Melakukan fit dan transformasi ke bentuk matrix

`(682, 2)`

Matriks yang dimiliki berukuran (682, 2). Nilai 682 merupakan ukuran data dan 2 merupakan matrik kategori artikel. Kemudian, menggunakan fungsi todense() untuk menghasilkan vektor tf-idf dalam bentuk matriks.

### Menghitung derajat kesamaan dengan Cosine Similarity
Saya menghitung cosine similarity dataframe tfidf_matrix yang diperoleh pada tahapan sebelumnya, output yang ditampilkan berupa matriks kesamaan dalam bentuk array.

Gambar 2. Cosine similarity

Angka 1.0 mengindikasikan bahwa artikel pada kolom X (horizontal) memiliki kesamaan dengan artikel pada baris Y (vertikal).

### Mendapatkan Rekomendasi
saya melihat data artikel salah satu artikel, misalkan artikel 15:

Gambar 3. Artikel 15

Dapat dilihat bahwa artikel 15 memiliki kategori sport.

Gambar 4. Hasil rekomendasi artikel

Dapat dilihat bahwa sistem merekomendasikan artikel dengan kategori yang sama yaitu _sport_.


## Evaluation
Evaluasi pada model _Machine Learning Content Based Filtering_ dapat menggunakan metriks _precission_, yaitu jumlah item rekomendasi yang relevan.
Berikut rumus dari metriks precision:

`Precision = #of recommendation that are relevant/#of item we recommend`

| 0 |      82 | coach ranieri sacked by valencia claudio ranieri has been sacked as valencia coach just eight months after taking charge at the primera liga club for the second time in his career. the decision was taken at a board meeting following the side s surprise elimination from the uefa cup. we understand and he understands that the results in the last few weeks have not been the most appropriate said club president juan bautista. former assistant antonio lopez will take over as the new coach. italian ranieri took over the valencia job in june 2004 having been replaced at chelsea by jose mourinho. things began well but the spanish champions extended their winless streak to six after losing to racing santander last weekend. that defeat was then followed by a uefa cup exit at the hands of steaua bucharest. ranieri first took charge of valencia in 1997 guiding them to the king s cup and helping them to qualify for the champions league. the 54-year-old then moved to atletico madrid in 1999 before joining chelsea the following year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | sport    |   |

[i m] absolutely spitting. i m livid. there s two tries we ve been cost robinson told bbc sport. we ve got to go back to technology. i don t know why we didn t. south african referee jonathan kaplan ruled that cueto was ahead of charlie hodgson when the fly-half hoisted his cross-field kick for the sale wing to gather. kaplan then declined the chance to consult the fourth official when josh lewsey took the ball over the irish line under a pile of bodies for what could have been the game-winning try. i think mark cueto scored a perfectly legal try and i think he should have gone to the video referee on josh lewsey said robinson. it is how we use the technology. it is there and it should be used. i am still trying to work out the cueto try. i have looked at both and they both looked tries. we are very disappointed and this will hurt there is no doubt about that. we are upset now but the referee is in charge and he has called it his way and we have got to be able to cope with that. we did everything we could have done to win the game. i am very proud of my players and with a couple of decisions this could have been a very famous victory. i thought we dominated. matt stevens had an awesome game at tighthead prop while the likes of charlie hodgson martin corry and lewis moody all came through well. josh lewsey was awesome and every one of the forwards stood up out there. given the pressure we were under credit must go to all the players. we have done everything but win a game of rugby but ireland are a good side. they defended magnificently and they ve got every chance of winning this six nations. england have lost their first three matches in this year s six nations and four out of their six games since robinson took over from sir clive woodward in september.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | sport    |   |
| 2 |     495 | arnesen denies rift with santini tottenham sporting director frank arnesen has denied that coach jacques santini resigned because of a clash of personalities at white hart lane. there had been newspaper speculation that santini had felt undermined by arnesen s role at the club. it is absolutely not true arnesen told bbc radio five live. there is only one thing that made him resign and that is his own personal problems. he has talked to me recently and said this matter is absolutely for himself. arnesen said he was unable to throw any light onto the problems that caused santini to quit after just 13 games in charge. he added: jacques has never gone into exactly what it was. but i trust him in that; you have to accept it. i think we should respect it. the plan is now that over the weekend we will have talks with the board and then on monday we will clarify the situation. arnesen countered criticism at the timing of the announcement coming less than 24 hours before tottenham s premiership fixture with charlton. when it comes down to personal problems i don t think we should talk about timing he said. and he also denied reports that santini had been given a £3m pay-off. that is absolute nonsense. he is the one who said i will go and so he went said the spurs sporting director. tottenham s structure of having a sporting director working alongside a coach is based on a continental model and arnesen sees no reason why they should change it. i have confidence in this structure. i am confident that we have started something here in july and i still have a lot of confidence in tottenham and what we are doing he said. however former spurs and england defender gary stevens said he would not be surprised if the system had caused a rift. i think the problems go a lot deeper between the director of football at white hart lane and santini stevens told five live. on paper they could have worked together. but frank arnesen was a very creative forward-thinking and expansive player - whereas i think santini was very much the opposite more a case of being organised disciplined and happy not conceding goals. that sort of arrangement can work if the two people have the same principles and ideals and work very closely. but it seems that has not happened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | sport    |   |
| 3 |     612 | bosvelt optimistic over new deal manchester city s paul bosvelt will find out within a month whether he is to be offered a new one-year deal. the 34-year-old dutch midfielder is out of contract in the summer and although his age may count against him he feels he can play on for another season. i told the club i would like to stay for one more year. they promised me an answer within the next month so i am waiting to see he said. the main concern is my age but i think i have proved i am fit enough. bosvelt joined city from feyenoord in 2003 and at first he struggled to adapt to life in england. but his professionalism and dedication impressed manager kevin keegan. he realised the pace of the game was faster than anything he was used to but he drove himself back into the team. he is an unsung hero said keegan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | sport    |   |

| 5 |    1214 | old firm pair handed suspensions celtic s henri camara and nacho novo of rangers have both been suspended for offences missed by the referee in a recent old firm game. both were given automatic one-match bans and 12 additional disciplinary points for their actions. that means novo will miss a further two games because of his prior record. camara will miss one additional game. novo was found guilty of stamping on celtic s stephen pearson. camara was punished for kicking gregory vignal. i m extremely disappointed. i don t know if there s a lot to add to that said rangers manager alex mcleish of novo s punishment. but what i will say is that i m at a loss as to why that incident should be picked up and highlighted when there were so many other incidents during the game. both players will miss this weekend s games when celtic host dundee united and rangers visit kilmarnock unless they decide to appeal. the additional bans come into effect from 28 december meaning camara will also be unavailable for the home game against livingston while novo will miss the meetings with dundee united and dunfermline. an sfa spokesman said: they have seven days to appeal but with matches coming along at the weekend they would need to do so before friday. but if they do appeal it won t be heard before this weekend because it takes a bit of time to seat up an appeals tribunal. meanwhile bob malcolm and rangers have been informed by letter as to the outcome of the hearing regarding his reaction to rangers being awarded a penalty in the same game. malcolm a substitute on the day was taken from the rangers dug-out and spoken to by police about an alleged gesture he made. but the sfa would not detail what if any punishment malcolm would receive. once rangers receive our letter we will be in a position to make a comment on the findings added the spokesman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | sport    |   |

| 7 |    1751 | connors rallying cry for british tennis do you have it in your heart how much guts do you have how much do you hate to lose these are the questions jimmy connors will be asking of britain s brightest tennis hopes in the months and possibly years to come. the american legend swept into london on thursday to announce a long-term relationship with the lawn tennis association after spending three days at the elite performance winter camp in la manga. and the man who epitomised the phrase will to win before lleyton hewitt was even born is clear about the qualities he hopes to convey. you know everybody hits the ball well and there s a very fine line between number one and number 100 said connors. i was that fine line for a long time. but if i can help i want to be part of teaching kids how to win. connors is not the first great name to offer his services to the lta - his long-time rival john mcenroe has repeatedly done the same. but connors is at pains to point out that his interest goes well beyond any publicity stunt and he gave a glowing recommendation to the work of lta performance director david felgate and his team. britain has a different attitude the right attitude in taking the game forward and finding the next wimbledon champion said connors. that s something you don t find every day. everybody talks a good game but not everybody puts that into effect. the impression i came away with after just seeing david and the other coaches for three days was one like i ve never seen before especially over here. this is not going to happen overnight there are no miracle workers but you re going in the right direction. the 52-year-old s enthusiasm for the work going on in this country is in marked contrast to his relationship with tennis officials back in america. i ve had discussions with the usta (united states tennis association) over a number of years he said. that s where it (my input) ended. connors is a straight-talker and will be equally blunt and honest in his dealings with the lta and the cream of britain s young players. if they re chosen they ve got to produce he said. if not someone will come and take their place. there s only one number one spot and it s lonely up there but it s got the best view. in the year that has seen andrew murray emerge as britain s great new hope connors rejected suggestions that the scot might be put under too much pressure too soon. tim henman has a whole country on his shoulder said connors. i don t know that pressure but if you like that it can be a certain push to get on to the next level. someone s going to have to come and take over from him (henman). if i was andrew murray i d embrace that. that s what we play for. despite the emphasis on hard work training and preparation connors does admit that the desire required of a champion has to come from within. the passion i had i don t know if you can find that he admitted. i was also nuts. i say that because there was nothing better for me than to compete on the tennis court. it was the most important thing in the world for me and to do that something s got to be not right with you. there was nothing better for me ever than to play tennis in front of 25 000 people. what i had when i played tennis is what i am. you have to have that you can t be moulded. | sport    |   |
| 8 |    1633 | edu blasts arsenal arsenal s brazilian midfielder edu has hit out at the club for stalling over offering him a new contract. edu s deal expires next summer and he has been linked with spanish trio real madrid barcelona and valencia. he told bbc sport: i m not sure if i want to stay or not because the club have let the situation go on this far. if they had really wanted to sign they should have come up with an offer six months before indicating they wanted to sign me and that s made me think. edu s brother and representative amadeo fensao has previously said that arsenal s current offer to the midfielder was well short of what he was seeking. and edu 26 added: my brother is due to come to london on thursday. there is a meeting planned for 6 or 7 january to sort it out with arsenal. now i have a choice to stay or go. i want to sort it out as soon as possible that s in the best interests of both the club and myself. i m going to make my decision after the meeting later this week. edu is now able to begin negotiations with other clubs because fifa regulations allow players to start talks six months before their contracts expire. the midfielder who broke in to the brazilian national side in 2004 admitted he had been flattered to have been linked with the three spanish giants. edu said: i ve just heard stories from the news that the madrid president florentino perez the valencia people as well as barcelona are interested. that s nice but i ve never talked to them so i can t say they want me sign 100%. last month wenger said he we was hopeful edu would sign a new deal and played down suggestions that the lure of a club like real madrid would be too strong for edu. edu added that he had been encouraged by wenger s support for him. i still have a good relationship with arsene wenger - he s always said he wants me to sign.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | sport    |   |
| 9 |    1750 | clijsters hope on aussie open kim clijsters has denied reports that she has pulled out of january s australian open because of her persistent wrist injury. open chief paul mcnamee had said: kim s wrist obviously isn t going to be rehabilitated. but her spokesman insisted she had simply delayed submitting her entry. the doctors are assessing her injury on a weekly basis and if there is no risk she could play. but if there s the least risk she will stay away. despite being absent from the wta entry list for the tournament which begins on 17 january clijsters would be certain to get a wild card if she requested one. clijsters is still ranked 22nd in the world despite only playing a handful of matches last season. the belgian had an operation on her left wrist early in the season but injured it again on her return to the tour. meanwhile jelena dokic who used to compete for australia has opted out of the first grand slam of the season. dokic has not played in the australian open since 2001 when she lost in the first round. but the 21-year-old would have had to rely on a wild card next season because her ranking has tumbled to 127th. four-time champion monica seles who has not played since last year s french open is another absentee because of an injured left foot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | sport    |   |
